## Introduction

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of the stock market. The aim of StockpredML is to experiment with different machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices and evaluate their effectiveness.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for time-series data.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms for prediction.
- Evaluation metrics for model performance.
- Visualization tools for better analysis of results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data handling and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For deep learning models (if applicable).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and testing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siddheshdumre/StockpredML.git
   cd StockpredML
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scriptsctivate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by placing it in the designated directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.
3. View the visualizations and predictions generated by each model.

## Models Implemented

- **Linear Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks** (if applicable)
- **Other Algorithms** as part of experimentation.

## Results

The project includes a comparison of model performances using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. Visualizations display the predicted versus actual stock prices.
